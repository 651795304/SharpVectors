## Tutorial Samples
In this directory you will find various tutorial samples in both C# and VB.NET languages. These samples are used in the tutorials documentations and demonstrate the uses of various features and services provided by the SharpVectors libraries.

This directory currently contains two sub-directories as listed below.

* ControlSamplesWpf
  These are samples demonstrating the controls, markup extensions and other services based on the WPF renderer.
* ConverterSamplesWpf
  These are samples demonstrating the SVG to XAML/WPF converters based on the WPF renderer.

These samples are simple, independent and mostly do not use other third-party libraries or packages.
